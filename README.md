# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud can occur when unauthorized users gain access to an individual's credit card information in order to make purchases, other transactions, or open new accounts.   In 2018, unauthorised financial fraud losses across payment cards and remote banking totalled £844.8 million in the United Kingdom. Whereas banks and card companies prevented £1.66 billion in unauthorised fraud in 2018. That is the equivalent to £2 in every £3 of attempted fraud being stopped.[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud)

The dataset used for this study contains trasactions made by credit cards in Septembre 2013 by European cardholders. It contains 284,807 instances that occured in two days where we have 492 fraud transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
